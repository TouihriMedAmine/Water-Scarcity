  "chapter_title": "Chapter 1 - Climate Change and the State of the Resource",
  "summary": "This chapter analyses the impact of climate change on water resources in Tunisia, focusing on the year 2023. It examines temperature increases, rainfall deficiencies, evapotranspiration, and their effects on surface and groundwater availability and quality. It also discusses non-conventional water resources like intended and treated summerwater, highlighting challenges and opportunities for improving water management in the face of climate change.",
  "key_points": [
    "2023 was the third hottest year in Tunisia since 1950, with temperatures exceeding normal levels across all seasons.",
    "Rainfall was 20% below age, though geographically variable, with some regions experimenting surplus rainfall.",
    "Evapotranspiration incremented, indicating greener water demand from the environment.",
    "Surface water availability is limited, with reservoir filling rates Declining.",
    "Groundwater resources are under increasing pressure due to excessive and illegal exploitation.",
    "The Map of Water Resources of Tunisia (CRET) project introduced a new approach to assessing water resources based on aquifer systems.",
    "Desalination is expanding but treated wastewater weuse is limited despite its potential.",
    "Water quality is compromised by pollution from urbanization, industrial activities, and agriculture.",
    "The INSPA's water quality control shows an increase in bacteriological non-compliance in drinking water.",
    "There is a quick of security plans to treat water and to control the effects of chlorination and THM production"
