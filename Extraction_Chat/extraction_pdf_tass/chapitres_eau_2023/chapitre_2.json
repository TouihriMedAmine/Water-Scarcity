  "chapter_title": "Chapitre 2 - Les usages de la ressource",
  "summary": "This chapter of the Tunisian Water Sector National Report 2023 focuses on the uses of water resources in Tunisia, particularly in the agricultural sector. It addresses the impact of water scarcity and climate change on key agricultural productions, including cereals, olive oil, date palm, and vegetable crops. It also analyses the concept of virtual water trade related to exports and imports.",
  "key_points": [
    "Persistent drought is exerting increasing stress on available water resources.",
    "Restrictions have been imposed on the use of drinking water, and SONEDE has implemented a water rationing program.",
    "Irrigation quotas from dams have been drastically reduced.",
    "Transfer systems have been fully mobilized to compensate water scarcity.",
    "Pressure on groundwater resources has increased, leading to illicit exploitation and negative socio-economic and environmental consequences.",
    "Water quality is an increasing concern due to urbanization, economic activities, and years of drought.",
    "The agricultural sector uses the most water, with irrigated agriculture accounting for approximately 75% of total water usage.",
    "The chapter analyzes the impact of climate change (CC) on water use and the water footprint of different agricultural products.",
    "The chapter discuss the vulnerability of key crops (cereals, olives, dates) to drought.",
    "The chapter explains the concept of virtual water and its implications for Tunisia's trade balance."
