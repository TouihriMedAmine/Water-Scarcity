# Optimization of Water Use in Agriculture - Irrigation Optimization

## Overview

Efficient irrigation is crucial for sustainable agriculture. This project aims to optimize irrigation by analyzing key environmental and soil factors to determine the best irrigation strategies, reducing water waste while ensuring optimal crop growth.

## Key Factors for Irrigation Optimization

To develop an accurate model for irrigation optimization, we consider various environmental, soil, and climate-related attributes. These factors influence water availability, plant water consumption, and soil water retention.

### 1. Factors Influencing Plant Water Consumption

These attributes help estimate how much water crops use and how much irrigation is required.

- **Evapotranspiration (Evap_tavg)**: The sum of soil evaporation and plant transpiration. A higher value indicates increased water loss, requiring more irrigation.
- **Plant Transpiration (Tveg_tavg)**: Measures water loss through plant stomata. High values indicate potential water stress.
- **Soil Evaporation (ESoil_tavg)**: Represents direct evaporation from bare soil, which contributes to water loss.
- **Potential Evaporation (PotEvap_tavg)**: The maximum possible evaporation under ideal conditions. Helps compare actual vs. potential water loss.

### 2. Factors Influencing Soil Water Retention

These attributes determine how much water remains in the soil and is available for plant growth.

- **Soil Moisture (SoilMoist_S_tavg)**: Overall soil moisture content.
- **Soil Moisture by Depth (SoilMoi0_10cm_inst)**: Indicates water storage in the top soil layer (0-10cm), critical for seed germination and young plants.
- **Root Zone Soil Moisture (RootMoist_inst)**: Directly measures water availability in the root zone, essential for assessing irrigation needs.

### 3. Factors Affecting Irrigation Demand

These attributes impact evapotranspiration and the soil's ability to retain water, thus influencing irrigation needs.

- **Air Temperature (Tair_f_inst)**: Higher temperatures increase evapotranspiration and water demand.
- **Solar Radiation (SWdown_f_tavg)**: More sunlight leads to higher evaporation and plant transpiration.
- **Precipitation (Rainf_tavg)**: Directly reduces irrigation requirements by adding natural water to the soil.

## Data Visualization and Processing

### Visualization Approach (converting_img.py)

Our project visualizes these key attributes using geospatial mapping techniques:

- Each attribute is visualized with a specific color map optimized for its value range:
  - Water consumption factors (Blues, Greens, YlOrBr, plasma)
  - Soil moisture indicators (turbo, Blues_r, GnBu)
  - Climate factors (coolwarm, YlOrRd, Blues)
- Geographic features (coastlines, borders) are added for spatial context
- Images are organized in separate folders by attribute type for easy analysis

### Image Enhancement Methods (image_upgrade.py)

To improve the resolution and quality of our visualizations, we implemented four upscaling techniques:

1. **Bilinear Interpolation**: Uses weighted average of four nearest pixels to create smooth transitions between pixels.

2. **Gradient-Based Enhancement**: Calculates directional gradients to better preserve edges and directional features in the data.

3. **Cubic Spline Interpolation**: Uses cubic polynomials to create a smoother interpolation that preserves curvature in the data.

4. **Texture-Preserving Method**: Enhances local texture patterns by analyzing neighborhood variance, particularly useful for preserving detailed soil and terrain patterns.

Each method increases image resolution by a factor of 3 (e.g., 3x3 to 9x9) while maintaining the original data distribution patterns.

## Conclusion

By integrating these variables into a Machine Learning model, we can accurately predict irrigation needs, reduce water waste, and ensure sustainable agricultural practices. This approach enhances crop productivity while conserving vital water resources.
