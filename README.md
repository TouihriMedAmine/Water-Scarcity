## üåç Project Overview
We built an integrated intelligent platform for climate forecasting, water level estimation, climate awareness, and interactive data visualization. The system empowers users to anticipate environmental changes, explore satellite-based predictions, and interact with a chatbot expert in water and climate issues.

## üß† Core Modules

## 1. Environmental Prediction (based on location and future date)
Three deep learning models predict:

üå° Average surface temperature (AvgSurfT)

üåß Rainfall (Rainf)

üí® Potential evapotranspiration (PotEvap)

Using coordinates and a future date as input, predictions are passed to a text generation model (LLM) that outputs a personalized environmental report.

## 2. Surface Runoff Prediction (ConvLSTM)
A ConvLSTM encoder‚Äìdecoder model forecasts surface runoff 6 days ahead using time-series of hydrometeorological grayscale image data (rainfall, soil moisture, base flow, and surface flow).

## 3. Water Level Estimation from Satellite Images
Using the RESISC45 dataset:

Classify images into lakes, rivers, and harbors

Estimate water levels (low, medium, high) using CNNs, U-Net, FCN, or ResNet

## 4. Droplets ‚Äî Domain-Specific Chatbot
A climate/water-focused AI chatbot powered by a fine-tuned local LLM. It answers questions about:

Climate change impact

Water use in agriculture, industry, and households

Smart technologies (AI, IoT, desalination)

Sustainability and policy strategies

Its knowledge is based on the ONAGRI 2023 report.

## 5. Unified Web Interface
A user-friendly web page allows:

Input of future date and location

Access to environmental predictions and generated report

Visualization of predictive maps

Interaction with the chatbot
